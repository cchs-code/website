        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>The Coding Club is a space where future aspiring developers can discuss and learn about computer science and programming. We want to introduce new students who are interested to the wonderful world that is computer science! Anyone is free to join and there are no requirements/prior experience required. </p>
      
      <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
  
      <h3>Learn by doing</h3>
      <p>We believe that the only way to truly understand something is by building projects. This means lots of hands-on projects in person!</p>
  
      <h3>Collaboration</h3>
      <p>It is a fact that two minds working together are better than one. Therefore, we encourage teamwork. We learn and make mistakes together.</p>
  
      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>There are two types of meetings that we hold. Informational meetings are held during lunch for about 30 minutes. These are to discuss future events and news. For now, we meet at the same time and place as STEAM Club does (room N215, Wednesdays lunch). The second kind are project meetings after school. This is where we participate in group activities and build projects. These will be from 3:30 to 5:00 in the computer lab (hopefully). Meeting times are subject to change depending on circumstances, which will be communicated beforehand.</p>
      
      <h2>Topics</h2>
      <p>The club will go through a variety of CS topics, such as web development, embedded programming (electronics and Arduinos), around every month or so.</p>
